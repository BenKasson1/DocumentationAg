  As the world's food demand increases, farmers require more analytics in order to make better decisions. 
  The team’s plan is to design, build, and test the proof of concept for a multi-sensor platform that will collect data
  on soil humidity, soil pH, and soil temperature. This system is intended to be as affordable and accurate as possible.
  The scope of this project is interesting, because while this team is small, the technology they're working on has many
  potential uses worldwide. This means that the team’s work could become a well cited/referenced example of automated
  farming technology as the field of automated farming expands.
